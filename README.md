- 👋 Hi, I’m @andyswings

- 👀 I’m interested in Python and web technologies, although I also have an interest in Linux system administration.

- 🌱 I’m currently continuing to learn Python and using it to automate my everyday tasks among other things. One of my earliest projects was to build a self driving car using a raspberry pi SBC ([auto-car-bot]([url](https://github.com/andyswings/auto-car-bot))).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Python projects that might contribute to my education. I am especially interested in collaborating on projects that focus on functional programming and OOP.
 
- 📫 You can reach me at andyswings#9651 on Discord.
